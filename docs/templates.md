We have prepared a variety of different styles so you can edit them to your needs.
For each style, you can edit the calendar and shape is as you need it.
If you are inspired, you can also just head over and [start from scratch]({{link.web}}).

> Are you proud of your calendar? Share it here!

## Mobile One Day Calendar Feed

Here is an example of a one day view of a Christmas day:

{{calendar_example("christmas-day.json", "300px")}}

Modifications:

- start and end time
- fixed date
- CSS

## Recurring Events with Categories

If you are at home, planning the days with the family, events might have
different categories depending on who they are for: `work` or `personal`.
Events can be single events or occur every day.

{{calendar_example("family-planning.json")}}

Modifications:

- start and end time
- fixed date
- CSS

## Events Hosted as a Tor Hidden Service

This calendar is not styled but contains events that can be hosted behind
a firewall on a little anonymous server. [Example](https://tor.open-web-calendar.hosted.quelltext.eu/calendar.html?url=http%3A%2F%2F3nbwmxezp5hfdylggjjegrkv5ljuhguyuisgotrjksepeyc2hax2lxyd.onion%2Fone-day-event-repeat-every-day.ics
)

Modifications:

- [proxy parameters](../host/configure#ssrf-protection-with-a-proxy-server)

## Choose Timezones

For an international calendar, you can allow choosing the time zone that the
events are displayed in.

--8<-- "choose-timezone.html"

{{calendar_example("timezone-example.json", id="owcTimezoneExample")}}

Below, you can see the source code that you need to add to your website.
You might need to adjust the timezone selection and the id of the iframe.

```
--8<-- "choose-timezone.html"
```

Modifications:

- JavaScript
- timezone

## Free and Busy

You can change the design based on whether you are free or busy.

This calendar has changed CSS so that the background is green and the
events are either orange or red.

{{calendar_example("free-and-busy.json")}}


Modifications:

- CSS
