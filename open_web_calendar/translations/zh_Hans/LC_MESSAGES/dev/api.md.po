msgid "API"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally, the Open Web Calendar is there to be used without restriction. "
"You can use this API to customize the calendar on the fly."
msgstr ""

msgid "This section can be of use if one of these applies:"
msgstr ""

msgid "You are a web developer who wants to embed the Open Web Calendar."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You want to exploit the full flexibility, not just what is exposed on the "
"configuration page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You want to use JavaScript to dynamically generate the calendar design and "
"options."
msgstr ""

msgid "You want to extend the functionality of the Open Web Calendar."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You want to use the Open Web Calendar as a proxy to request JSON events for "
"your self-made event feed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Endpoints"
msgstr ""

msgid "The basic parameters are the same at these endpoints:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`/index.html` - edit the calendar"
msgstr ""

msgid "`/about.html` - view the about page"
msgstr ""

msgid "`/calendar.html` - view the calendar"
msgstr ""

msgid "`/calendar.spec` - download the specification"
msgstr ""

msgid "`/calendar.ics` - subscribe to the ics file"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`/calendar.events.json` - FLEXIBLE - get the events as JSON Please note that"
" you CAN use this but you cannot be sure that the JSON schema remains the "
"same. If you want that, add tests."
msgstr ""

msgid "Additional parameters are required:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`timezone=UTC` - the timezone that you need to display the events in"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`from=YYYY-MM-DD` - the start of the period in which events happen "
"(inclusive)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`to=YYYY-MM-DD` - the end of the period in which events happen (exclusive)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All configuration parameters are described sufficiently in the "
"[default_specification]. That is the reference. E.g. if you find the "
"parameter `title` in the [default_specification], you have several options:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding Parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you add a new parameter as a developer,"
msgstr ""

msgid "Add the parameter with a default value to the [default_specification]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add an implementation, depending on its use in the `app.py` or the templates"
" of the JavaScript files. The specification is already available in all of "
"them to use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add tests in [features/configure-the-"
"calendar.feature](https://github.com/niccokunzmann/open-web-"
"calendar/tree/master//features/configure-the-calendar.feature) to check that"
" the calendar responds to the feature."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add tests in [features/edit-the-"
"calendar.feature](https://github.com/niccokunzmann/open-web-"

"the parameter can be used when a calendar is edited."

msgid "Compiling the Specification"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can change the calendar behavior and looks with parameters. These are "
"the places to specify parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Query parameters** All parameters to the calendar url are put into the "
"specification. The query parameters have the highest precedence. Examples:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**specification_url** If you specify this query parameter, the editor "
"configuration is loaded from this url, too. Query parameters are still more "
"important than what is written in this file. The source format can be YAML "
"or JSON. Examples:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**[default_specification]** This file contains the default parameters. They "
"must not be hard-coded in the source code. All of them are there. Query "
"parameters and the `specification_url` override these values."

msgid ""
"The base of a calendar is the specification, given in the various forms. "
"This specification influences all the steps."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the specification is compiled, the calendar (ics) files are downloaded"

msgstr ""

msgid "From the calendar files, the events are generated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then, different views are chosen to display the events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the end, these lead to HTML and style changes of the calendar website."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the real application, these steps are bit bit mixed up and unordered or "
"omitted but this explains simply the basic, initial idea behind the event "
"processing."
