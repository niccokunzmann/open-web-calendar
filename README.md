Python: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10

There are several commercial solutions which allow embedding of calendars into my website.
I only have a link to an ICS file and want to show a nice-looking calendar on my site.
Browser-only calendars usually have the problem that many ICS files can not be
accessed (such as ownCloud/nextCloud in my case).
I also want to be in control over who knows the people who
visit the site and not pass everything to Google.
This is a solution in my case which I share with the world.
You are free to use it or deploy your own, modify or share it.
It works offline and in company networks, too.

Features
- Embedded calendar
- Choice of time zone
- ICS link, best multiple
- month/week as a view
- name, time of event, link?
- showing the time span
- styling of choice (icon, color, font, ...)

## Deployment

You can deploy the app using Heroku.
There is a free plan.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Heroku uses [gunicorn](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/dev/deploying/wsgi-standalone/#gunicorn)
to run the server, see the [Procfile](Procfile).

### Environment Variables - Configuration

These environment variables can be used to configure the service:

- `APP_DEBUG` default `true`, values `true` or `false`, always `false` in the Docker container
  Set the debug flag for the app.
- `PORT` default `5000`, default `80` in the Docker container  
  The port that the service is running on.
- `WORKERS` default `4` only for the Docker container  
  The number of parallel workers to handle requests.
- `CACHE_REQUESTED_URLS_FOR_SECONDS` default `600`  
  Seconds to cache the calendar files that get downloaded to reduce bandwidth and delay.

### Docker

To build the container yourself type the command
```
docker build --tag niccokunzmann/open-web-calendar .
```

You can also use the existing image: [niccokunzmann/open-web-calendar](https://hub.docker.com/r/niccokunzmann/open-web-calendar).

```
docker run -d --rm -p 5000:80 niccokunzmann/open-web-calendar
```

Then, you should see your service running at http://localhost:5000.

### Docker Compose

Using pre build dockerhub image with docker-compose

```
version: '3'
services:
  open-web-calendar:
    image: niccokunzmann/open-web-calendar
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    environment:
      - WORKERS=4
    restart: unless-stopped
```

To deploy the open-web-calendar with docker-compose, do the following steps:
1. Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to the directory from where you want to run the container.
2. If needed change port mapping and environment variables.
3. Type `docker-compose up -d` to start the container.
4. The container will be pulled automatically from dockerhub and then starts.

#### Update prebuild image with Docker Compose

If you want to update your image with the latest version from dockerhub type `docker-compose pull`

Note: You need to start the container after pulling again in order for the update to apply (`docker-compose up -d`)

### Vercel

You can create a fork of this repository which automatically deploys to Vercel:

[Deploy](https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fniccokunzmann%2Fopen-web-calendar.git)

Alternatively you can create a one off deploy by cloning this repository and running `npx vercel` at the root.

Software Components
-------------------

- Python3 and the packages in requirements.txt
  - [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- [DHTMLX scheduler](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/)
- [python-recurring-ical-events](https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events)


Development
-----------

1. Optional: Install virtualenv and Python3 and create a virtual environment.
    ```
    virtualenv -p python3 ENV
    source ENV/bin/activate
    ```
2. Install the packages.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Start the app.
    ```
    python3 app.py
    ```

For the configuration of the app through environment variables,
see the [app.json] file.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, we use `tox`.
`tox` tests all different Python versions which we want to 
be compatible to.

```
pip install tox
```

Run all tests:

```
tox
```

Run a specific Python version:

```
tox -e py39
```

### Updating Dependencies

We use `pip-compile` to guarantee a
tested deployment by fixing all
the dependencies to a specific
version.

You can update the packages to the latest version:

```
rm requirements.txt test-requirements.txt
pip install --upgrade pip-tools -r requirements.in -r test-requirements.in
pip-compile -o requirements.txt requirements.in
pip-compile -o test-requirements.txt test-requirements.in
```

And run the tests:
```
tox
```
